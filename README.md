## The original README

Matheoroids by Tornozelos from group D  

I don't know why I created this repository. Please, for the love of all that's good, don't actually read my code.
I had a fever when I started writing the code. Therefore, I started writing garbage code and somehow I didn't stop.
PS. I didn't use the letter w in the code because I don't have a w key. (I had to use Ctrl + V for this README)
